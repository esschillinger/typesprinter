# Welcome to TypeSprinter!

4. Open a browser and go to the output link `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

Alternatively, you can visit [TypeSprinter's Website](http://typesprinter.herokuapp.com/) to play--no extra work required! Currently hosting the 2/19/2020 version of the app.

## Race Another User

Choose any `room_id` that you'd like and tell your friend(s) to join you in the same room! Supports 2+ players as well! If you'd like to reuse the same `room_id` again, be sure that everyone that has joined has finished the race, otherwise the passage won't reset.

## Practice

You can start typing whenever you'd like, which will start the timer. Just you, the passage, and the clock.

## Generate a Passage

Still in development, though currently semi-functional but mostly incoherent. Type a word, any word, and if it's currently known to the cloud "dictionary," it'll be used to generate a random sentence (and random it is, at the moment). You can then type this entirely unique sentence, never before read by another human being, as your practice passage.

## Commands

Not for you! Nice try, though. All you'll see is a blank screen, but I've got some tricks up my sleeve, being the creator and all :)
